Web Interface
=============

A Web Interface is built into all Transmission flavours, enabling them to be controlled remotely.

Enabling the Web Interface
--------------------------

Refer to the **Remote Management** links in the :ref:`User Documentation <user-docs>` for your client to find out how to enable the Web Interface.

Accessing the Web Interface
---------------------------

Once enabled, open a web browser and direct it to http\://<IP address of machine running Transmission>:9091/. If web browser and Transmission Daemon are on the same machine you can use http\://127.0.0.1:9091/.

9091 is the default remote control port specified in :ref:`Transmission configuration <editing-config-files-ref>`.
